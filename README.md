Located within the index.html file created for Oregon State University, Geovisual Analytics is a choropleth map of airports in the United States. The map features airplane icons to show all the airports within the United States and color coded planes to distinguish between airports that have or do not have control towers. A scale bar and legend are also included to show the quantity of airports per state. The zoom of the basemap allows the user to begin at the main portion of the US and navigate to the other US territories. The basemap was provided by leaflet-providers and other sources include font awesome and colorbrew.org. Lastly, the airports data was provided by Data.gov and the US state boundaries data was provided by Mike Bostock.
